## question

heyo. can you explain to me what a MoE implementation is in an LLM? like, what is a 2x7b model and how does it differ from a single 7b model? i've heard it's something like having an agent that can pass information to the LLM that is best at a given task (and i've seen people theorize that GPT4 is a MoE model).

## answer

A Mixture of Experts (MoE) model is a type of neural network architecture that consists of multiple "expert" sub-models, each specialized for a different task or type of input data. The key components are:

- Multiple expert modules - smaller neural networks each trained on a specific task or domain. For example, one expert could specialize in summarization, another in translation, another in factual QA, etc.
- A gating module - this takes the input and decides which expert module(s) should handle it. Often implemented as a lightweight neural network.
- An aggregator - combines the outputs from the different experts into a final output.

So in a 2x7B MoE model, there would be two separate 7 billion parameter expert modules. The gating module would route inputs to the appropriate expert, get the output, and the aggregator would combine them.

The main advantage of MoE is that each expert can become very specialized, often outperforming a single monolithic model. The gating/routing mechanism allows easily scaling to add more experts.

For example, a 7B parameter "generalist" model might perform decently at many tasks, but a 2x7B MoE model could have one expert fine-tuned for translation and one for QA, allowing each to excel at their specialty.

The downside is increased training and inference complexity to learn routing functions and combine outputs. There are also challenges in maintaining coherence when different experts handle successive inputs.

So in summary, MoE architectures allow training modules specialized for different tasks that can outperform single general models, at the cost of more training and inference complexity. GPT-4 is speculated to be a MoE model but the details are still unknown.
