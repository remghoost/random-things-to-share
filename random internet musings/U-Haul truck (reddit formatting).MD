**I mean, first off, I totally** ***could*** **stop a U-Haul truck with a spear (in theory).**

A well placed stab to the tire or a throw hard enough to crack the radiator would effectively put the truck out of order. Heck, even just chuck a spear through the windshield at the right angle and take out the driver.

**tl;dr - A human could more than likely win a 1v1 with a U-Haul truck and only a spear. A group of humans, most definitely.**

tl;dr 2- Caffeine and weed made me do this. I used AI for some of the planning and theory crafting. ChatGPT and Claude are wusses and wouldn't even field my questions. Luckily [OpenHermes-2.5-Mistral-7B](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/OpenHermes-2.5-Mistral-7B-16k-GGUF) was more than willing. Local AI ftw. I have no regrets.

**But, in the vein of** r/whowouldwin, **if the truck was "bloodlusted", sentient, and its only goal was to escape, it would be a bit trickier.**

## Preamble

**First, we've got to set some ground rules.**

* I will assume I am facing off against [the Ford e450 variant](https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news/2017-ford-e-450-the-last-ride-of-the-american-v10-186053_1.jpg). Some cursory googling and asking AI leads me to believe this is a fairly common model.
* I will assume that my spear is made of materials that could be scavenged from the U-Haul truck (since this a world where U-Haul trucks are "grazing" animals).
* I will assume that my level of technology is at the level of humans from that era (approx. the Upper Paleolithic Pleistocene era, between 50,000 and 10,000 years ago). Crude blades, burins, bone tools, etc. No basic/advanced metallurgy.

A "deathblow" would be considered for the truck if either both of its rear wheels were popped (as the e450 is a rear wheel drive vehicle) or the engine was damaged enough to stop working.

A "deathblow" for the human would be anything that would prevent them from continuing the hunt. Death (obviously), a broken arm/leg, etc.

## Our weapon

Realistically (lmao), we'd want a longer spear. The truck would be fairly dangerous up close (especially if frightened).

AI suggests a 6-7 ft spear. Ancient Greek Hoplite spears were around 7-9 ft in length while Roman spears (known as a pilum) were around 5-6.5 ft. We will settle on a comfortable 7 ft for our discussion.

**We can assume that my spearhead would be created from the strongest metals possible from the truck.**

* It's not unfeasible to believe that a human with tools of that era could *eventually* rework/cut-down a piece of steel. It would take time, but it is doable.
* AI suggests either the frame or axle components. Both would be suitable, but I believe the frame would be easier to work with.

**The spear haft (handle) is a bit tricker.**

* A hard wood haft would be a decent choice. It could be reinforced with wire or rubber strapping for better handling/comfort.
* Aluminum is a fairly soft metal and could be molded to the outside of the haft to provide more rigidity.
* You could also use the top supporting bars of the box for a handle. They seem to be T shaped angled metal, [as seen in this picture](https://www.motorbiscuit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Inside-of-a-box-truck.jpg). Use two and lash them together with wire. AI seems to believe they are made of steel, but I'm not entirely sure about that. Steel is approximately 3 times heavier than aluminum. It would be a far more rigid shaft, but the weight would probably not be worth the extra strength.

We will assume a hard wood handle reinforced with aluminum.

|:-|:-|
|Spearhead|Steel fashioned from truck frame|
|Handle|Hardwood with Aluminum reinforcement|

**We will set forth a few scenarios.**

## Round 1 - One U-Haul truck vs. Me with a spear

**If I couldn't land a direct hit to a "vital organ" (as mentioned above), my first thought is just to chase/track it.**

* U-Haul trucks (along with all other contemporary vehicles) have a limited fuel tank. It would run out of fuel eventually. And as another commenter mentioned, humans are *excellent* at long distance running.

A glancing blow to a "vital organ" would allow for better tracking, as the truck would leak fluids. Not very relevant, but a useful piece of information nonetheless.

**If the truck could be "herded", it could probably be forced into a less-than-ideal situation.**

* A river, a densely wooded forest, cliff, etc. It's a U-Haul truck, therefore it would need to back up and turn around to change directions.
* This would allow for better utilization of the spear, affording me a few quick jabs instead of a hail-mary throw.
* The Ford e450 is a rear-wheel-drive vehicle, so taking out both of its back tires would effectively be a "killing blow" (as rims would be absolutely *useless* off road).
* A stab to the radiator *could* disable the truck entirely (after the engine overheated). Depends on the composition of the front grille (metal or plastic) to be effective.

**The truck would still be a formidable foe.**

* Getting hit by the truck would be game over for the human. If not instant death, a broken leg/arm would immediately stop the hunt.
* Dodging the incoming "beast" would probably be fairly easy in a wide open field (as depicted by the original post), but it would be difficult to even get close if the vehicle was sentient. I picture it doing a spinning burnout to dissuade oncoming attackers.

## Champion

|Combatant|Estimated chance of victory|
|:-|:-|
|Human|75%|
|U-Haul|25%|

**Heavily human favored** (especially if the human attempts the long distance running method), **though the truck could still come out ahead in some scenarios.** Not a walk in the park, but doable.

## Round 2 - One U-Haul truck vs. A group of humans armed with spears

**We will assume all of the starting conditions as laid out in the prior round (spear type, strategies, etc.)**

According to various online sources, human hunting parties of that era could range between 8 and 15 people. All of them will be equipped with spears as stated above.

**It would be difficult for the humans to lose in this scenario.**

* If one human was wounded, the others could continue fighting.
* Tracking parties could be employed, ensuring that one group never got tired enough to lose the trail.
* A group of humans could feasibly create a blockade from fallen trees.

**Things to consider**

* It would be difficult to surround the truck as it could just ram through a blockade of that size.

## Champion

|Combatant|Estimated chance of victory|
|:-|:-|
|Group of humans|95%|
|U-Haul|5%|

**This isn't even a fair fight.** All of the advantages of being human (intelligence, staying power, etc), but none of the downsides of being alone. Humans would win this, hands down.

**If you notice, I'm leaving 5% of wiggle room for the U-Haul.** A successful ram through the group could be devastating. And a large vehicle is still very dangerous to a squishy human body. This is an extremely unlikely outcome, but it would be foolish of us to entirely count out the U-Haul truck.

## Round 3 - A pack of U-Haul trucks vs A group of humans

**I'm just including this because it's freaking hilarious to think about.**

Same tactics apply to the previous two rounds. Humans would win by splitting one off from the group.

I don't need to go into more detail, I just wanted you to picture a pack of U-Haul trucks on the grazing fields of the Upper Paleolithic Pleistocene era.

## Champion

|Combatant|Estimated chance of victory|
|:-|:-|
|Group of humans|94%|
|A pack of U-Haul trucks|6%|

**There could be more casualties on the human side though.** I bumped my estimation for the U-Haul trucks up by one percent. Due to sheer numbers alone, it would be more difficult to not become wounded in the ensuing fight.

I would assume that the humans have already perfected group hunting tactics (herding, isolation, etc), so the trucks only get one extra percent.

## Extra considerations

**Humans could fashion many other weapons from the deceased carcass of the mighty U-Haul truck.**

* Gasoline could be used to make molotov-like throwing implements. This could melt tires, hoses, belts, etc.
* Glass and sharp metal pieces could be crafted into caltrop-like devices. An Upper Paleolithic human could feasibly create a spike strip like device from these resources. Fabric from the cushions or carpet could be the base.

**Here's some interesting suggestions from our future AI overlords**

* Bows and slingshots from the rubber.
* A harpoon gun fashioned from the springs off of the suspension (I like this idea a lot)
* Catapult from the door spring.
* Striker pistol using the spark plugs. Not really feasible without gunpowder, but I like the effort.
* Using sheets of metal for defensive options.
* A chariot using one of the axles. Could be pulled behind a work animal. Love this one too.

**There are also some possible boons from the truck in general.**

* A car jack would be an amazing tool in this era, drastically improving the human's ability to set up prior.
* Ratchet straps and bungee cords would also be extremely helpful in many situations.
